# message-passing-interface : This algorithm helps us to perform image analysis,as image is represented in the form of rows and columns.

Requirement : Application is responsible to perform multiplcation on two matrices.

Steps :

1.Code will read the first matrix.
2.Once it is read, it will prepare the matrix dimension(Number of rows and columns present in the first matrix).
3.Then it will read the second matrix.
4.Once it is read, it will prepare the matrix dimension(Number of rows and columns present in the second matrix).
5.Once we have both matrix dimenstions, matrix multiplication should be performed.In-order to multiply two matrices, below condition 
should be met.

----->Number of columns present in the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows present in the second matrix.Then the resultant
      matrix will be having a dimension(Number of rows in first matrix * Number of columns in second matrix).

6.Application checks for the above condtion, if it satisfied one two dimensional-array will be prepared with the help of rows in first
matrix and columns in second matrix to hold the result of two matrix multiplication.
7.Once the resultant matrix is prepared, multiplication will be performed on the both matrices to store the result into newly created array.
8.After the result is determined, it will be stored in a specific file at one location("c:/temp/") in local machine where one can check the file with 
the name("samplefile.txt").
